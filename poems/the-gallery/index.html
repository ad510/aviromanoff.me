        <p><p>Let me tell you a little something about myself<br>
And hold your answers for the end<br>
<br>
I wear my glasses like shades<br>
and my clothes like camouflage<br>
Hoping that one day they’ll stop persecuting for the physicals<br>
and let me write my physics paper in peace<br>
<br>
Or write a poem about my problems<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;without being shoved into a locker<br>
Or read a poem about your answers<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;without being spat on when I ask if I can play soccer<br>
<br>
Look, I’m sorry I don’t cry when I play on my harp<br>
and pluck heartstrings into arrows of emotion<br>
as poignant as they are sharp<br>
<br>
My words lose their sting when they’re penned down against their will<br>
<br>
I’m just not cut out to chew up my feelings and spit out my insecurity<br>
I like to peck at the crud of life and laugh at its immaturity<br>
I’m going to wait for my knight in shining armor to save me<br>
Or at least savour the sweet scent of salvation<br>
<br>
Meanwhile I’ll hide behind my metaphors<br>
Take cover like krill in an endless sea of similies<br>
<br>
Armed with alliteration and my precocious personification pistol<br>
I March into battle like a lion<br>
and come out a listless little lamb clutching my watch crystal.<br>
Where’s Matthew Shepherd when I need him?<br>
<br>
<em>They can’t see me if I can’t see them</em><br>
<em>They can’t hear me if I laugh louder</em><br>
<em>They can’t hold me if I push them away</em><br>
And I can’t trust them and still stand prouder<br>
<br>
Shoot down my inner voice and hope the mug-shot’s a composite<br>
Because I’ll be long gone before the gestapo tries to shake me from my closet<br>
<br>
Maybe my dreams are poetry that I don’t have the balls to write<br>
Magnificent inarticulate artwork given to me by the goddess of the night<br>
<br>
Don’t get me wrong though<br>
<br>
I’m not saying this is the whole picture<br>
I can see only as far as paintbrush bristles,<br>
But judging by the watercolor rainbow dripping down the easel,<br>
I’ve got a bright future waiting for me after a high school of dismissals<br>
<br>
I just wonder how long it’ll be before it’s our time<br>
to be hung up in the gallery with the other survivors of hate crime<br>
<br>
I hear there’s some lovely blacks and whites on display down South<br>
And news of the installation of vibrant yellows is spreading by word of mouth<br>
<br>
The reconstructed reddish reservation refurbished from<br>
smokey has-been Casinos is still settling in<br>
<br>
And the exhibit in the middle of the East wing is<br>
expected to be an excellent display of neo-modern art<br>
at least once the massive iron sculptures finish cooling<br>
and the blockades have all been torn apart<br>
<br>
Oh yeah, I’m looking forward to the opening of the gallery<br>
Because on that day they’ll let me write my poetry without fear of abnormality<br>
And won’t <strong>dare</strong> judge me by my God-given sexuality</p>

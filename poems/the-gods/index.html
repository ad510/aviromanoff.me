        <p><p>Once, there was a little boy who lived in <em>New York City</em><br>
And the one thing he loved more than anything else<br>
More than anything in the whole world<br>
Was friendship<br>
<br>
His obsession started in the third week of September<br>
It was his second day of fourth grade<br>
And it was show-and-tell<br>
The little boy sat glued to chair<br>
With his eyes to the blackboard<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was magic happening<br>
Child after child was called and presented<br>
Each more nervous than the last<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gulping<br>
With just enough conviction<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To pull their feet together<br>
But not enough courage<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To keep them from shaking<br>
Applause was the music of friendship<br>
And the drumbeat of acceptance<br>

<br>
One by one the children presented<br>
Their worldly and otherworldly possessions<br>
Humble offerings met with expecting half-smiles<br>
For the gods of peer pressure facing them in box formation<br>
<br>
Finally, it was the little boy’s turn<br>
He walked himself to the front of the classroom<br>
“Hi, I was assigned the letter ‘T’ and I brought in my favorite t-shirt”<br>
Carefully he unballed the gray cotton fabric<br>
Wrinkled like crinkles on a crumpled paper<br>
Bright blue slanty squiggles danced on its well-worn front<br>
“It says ‘Allahu Akbar’”<br>
<br>
The room gasped and exhaled in unanimous lock-step<br>
Expressions sank from anticipating smirks<br>
To uncomfortable contortions of agitation<br>
The little boy stood perplexed and confused<br>
Accusations flew over his head<br>
“You can’t be my friend!” one boy said<br>
“My parents told me never to speak to Maslins!”<br>
“Yeah!” another confirmed<br>
<em>“You killed my dad.”</em><br>
<br>
The little boy ran outside and into reality<br>
A product of factors beyond his control or reading level<br>
<em>“How many ‘i’s are in suicide bomber?”</em><br>
<br>
Abdul Mohammed started school 6 days after September 11th<br>
The day evil brought down the towers and dignity for all<br>
<br>
From then on, his life became a prison<br>
With friendship taunting from beyond the cell<br>
High-fives stung like slaps from lack of contact<br>
He would sit on the playground and have staring contests with the sand<br>
Counting God’s promises to go forth and multiply<br>
Until they kicked it in his face and knocked his hopes to ground zero<br>
<br>
But Abdul was a thinker<br>
While others sat and laughed and jumped and cried<br>
He occupied his time with just the first and the last<br>
Struggling with everyday problems<br>
Like why they called him towelhead<br>
When his never left the bathroom<br>
And what Father meant when he said<br>
“Working poor should be an oxymoron”<br>
<br>
But Abdul was a thinker trapped in a world of doers<br>
Living in the 8-to-3 ghetto under the grade school Gestapo<br>
He dared not speak even when spoken at<br>
Planning for his next offering to the gods<br>
To please those with just enough knowledge<br>
To sow seeds of hate<br>
But not enough wisdom<br>
To nurture tolerance<br>
<br>
And then Abdul Mohammed wrote something in his diary and fell asleep:<br>
<br>
<em>We must not lose the runways to the ruthless</em><br>
<em>Or we’ll end up leaving the whole world blind and toothless</em></p>

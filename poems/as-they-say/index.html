        <p><p>When we were young<br>
Everything was just so<br>
Acceptable<br>
Up was up<br>
Home was home<br>
Buses came and buses went<br>
Everything just was, to a great extent<br>
Lying dormant under our collective animal skin<br>
Life was a simple safety-pin<br>
<br>
But as they say<br>
“All good things must bend”<br>
And so began the start of what we could scarcely comprehend<br>
“Acceptable” became a privilege<br>
Not a right<br>
We tacitly agreed to this life of hesitation<br>
Words were enemies<br>
Mirrors, friends<br>
Simultaneously in awe of the camera lens<br>
Yet unwilling to be filmed whilst holding pens<br>
Confined to the barbed garden of “Hot or not”<br>
We developed secrets<br>
Strings of sounds restricted<br>
Our freedom of screech evicted<br>
Confined to house parties to which none were invited<br>
Too cruel for school<br>
None could escape the awful rule<br>
<br>
For as they say<br>
“Do unto others as you could not bear done unto you”<br>
When defence becomes synonymous with assault<br>
There’s a clear path to hitting the asphalt<br>
It’s judge or be judged by default<br>
You must escape the mold<br>
Don’t break it &mdash; that’s the way too many good ideas end up undersold<br>
Choose your destiny &mdash; open sesame!<br>
Be your own man when no one dares<br>
Boycott this rotten state of affairs<br>
Anti-hate demonstrations staffed as the world prepares<br>
A new world order of acceptance<br>
In which <em>everyone</em> cares<br>
<br>
“All for one and One shall fall”<br>
As they had said before the problems became inter-bred<br>
Self-righteous gentiles by day<br>
Human rights pacifists by night<br>
Nonviolent extremists marching with<br>
Occupy Library protesters<br>
Fighting for the right to resemble<br>
Shady figureheads in the shadow of battles worth fighting for<br>
The Interpersonal Civil War<br>
Keys chaste in locks of stone<br>
Mindlessly encircling the holy throne<br>
<br>
Sundays were formally declared “Reflection days”<br>
Clamoring to buy pre-skipped rocks<br>
Children gathered by the docks<br>
Accepting the days gone by<br>
Promises eternally unspoken<br>
Their souls of atonement cracked and broke open<br>
Collecting thoughts by the dime<br>
They stood accused of a victimless crime<br>
As they said in unison the words of the great vindicator<br>
“All the world’s a stage, and each of us is a player-hater”</p>

The hardest part of growing up is discovering there’s no pause button<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or rewind,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or fast forward,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or snooze,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or repeat forever<br>
Realizing that <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;life<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;simply <br>
our choices<br>
But choice is only two-thirds of chance<br>
That the outcome is all that ever matters<br>
But you’ll never see it in advance<br>
<br>
You see God handed us the remote control but he took out the batteries<br>
Left us to sort out the negatives and the positives<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which words leave us feeling empty<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And which inspire an optimist?<br>
<br>
Sometimes we feel inspired and write ourselves and instruction manual<br>
Diagrams to troubleshoot the divine connection<br>
Or safety warnings for facing rejection<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2 double-A alkaline&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; batteries<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Phillips head unscrews the back<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;The hands are the hands of Essau&rdquo;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then sun darkened and so began the attack<br>
<br>
Sometimes we get cocky and ditch it<br>
Maybe when shower heads spray gas<br>
Play like we’re in control for a while<br>
And  yet this too shall pass<br>
<br>
See the remote’s a double-edged machine<br>
And the same second that might be your worst nightmare<br>
Might be someone’s lucid wet dream<br>
<br>
So do we replay the wedding or the funeral?<br>
Skip over your grandson’s first kiss<br>
Or the refugee’s unheard dying wish?<br>
<br>
Press snooze through child abuse<br>
Or an innocent man escaping the noose?<br>
<br>
Who could make such choices?<br>
Maybe that’s why time permits no backseat drivers<br>
Not for you, me, or Khmer Rouge survivors<br>
<br>
You think six billion arms on a wheel would steer towards Heaven?<br>
Let alone proper gas mileage in such a recession?<br>
<br>
But rest assured,<br>
We’ll never be given the chance to abuse it<br>
And sooner or later we must all face the music.<br>
<br>
Because life’s not an iPod<br>
And all we want is <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Speech! Speech! Speech!&rdquo;<br>
From the big guy upstairs<br>
To feel a warm friendly nod<br>
That shows us he cares<br>
But all we get back is the creaking of a rocking chair<br>
Someone sipping Jack Daniel’s<br>
And maybe the low static-y buzz<br>
Of someone flipping through the channels

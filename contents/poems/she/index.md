<p>I can’t bare to look at her<br>
Black paint borders her face<br>
Ever anorexically slimming with no end in sight<br>
Each day is the same day<br>
Selling out her body for a few cheap bucks<br>
The price is whatever she can convince you to pay<br>
In under ten seconds — the pitch is made<br>
Another price dropped like a bomb on the unsuspecting cities of our minds<br>
A sixth of a minute and it’s been slashed through and through<br>
And before you can even think for a second or two<br>
The price is falling, the price is falling!<br>
Buy one, get chained for free<br>
But do it soon before He comes back<br>
He can’t bear another panic attack<br>
<br>
She wants you to know the truth<br>
It’s their fault<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They did this to me&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Them<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Right
there&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Blame
them&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Accuse
them&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Deny them<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Decry them&nbsp;<br>
But whatever you do, don’t listen to them<br>
<br>
Diseased, sick in the head<br>
Pitting man against man<br>
Paying him to see red<br>
She would rather drug herself out on cheap laughs and quick tears<br>
Not enough poverty on the streets<br>
She must augment her fears<br>
<br>
Lurking around from dusk to dusk<br>
Filling the darkness with blinding emotions<br>
Not enough problems to silence her hateful promotions<br>
Forced to create<br>
<strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;B</strong>lood<br>
<strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A</strong>ction<br>
<strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;D</strong>rama<br>
Elaborate solutions to problems that never existed<br>
She bullies her friends who aren’t enlisted<br>
The army of insanity only eats free ranged<br>
Unwilling to realize they’re mentally deranged<br>
<br>
The world outside is but one of her many personalities<br>
Relegated to sensationalist headlines and lies<br>
Telling you anything while muffling the cries<br>
Money and power<br>
Stuffed to the teeth<br>
She buys back her health from fake doctors without licenses<br>
Selling canned happiness and beauty-in-a-bottle<br>
The needles, the lasers, the drugs<br>
Over the counter and into the river<br>
Buying happiness with coins, mugs, and gold<br>
Dying and cold<br>
Always an answer for every objection<br>
Nobody can bear to pose the question:<br>
<br>
America, how dare you watch television?</p>

**This is** not a love poem<br>
<br>
Not some projection of affection packaged in an essay<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Starting with how our relationship is the definition of cliche<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Topped tastefully with an “I’ve never felt this way”<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And some store-bought sweet nothings (just for display)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All tossed into some sugary scrumptious communique <br>
I’ll save the wordplay souffle for another day, okay?<br>
<br>
It isn’t for lack of caring, daring, or honesty, honestly<br>
It’s not because I think it sounds silly<br>
Or because saying your name makes my palms go chilly<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because it isn’t, and they don’t<br>
<br>
**This is** me going out on a limb<br>
<br>
It’s just that I don’t always know what to say<br>
This next line, for example<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The one you’re reading right at this time<br>
Took me <span style="text-decoration:underline">countless</span> times to write<br>
And in the end I settled for a cheesy rhyme<br>
<br>
But really I think the point I’m trying to make<br>
Is that it’s actually a *good* thing at heart<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...not the settling part<br>
Rather the realization of this strange art<br>
<br>
**This is** you shaking up my system<br>
<br>
I’ve no choice but to choose my words carefully for you<br>
Consider how things sound from another point of view<br>
And if it sounds like I’m being <span style="text-decoration:underline">cliche</span>, I’m not<br>
Seriously &mdash; I even used that word before (in another spot)<br>
<br>
All I’m saying is that I think you’re worth it<br>
Even if I don’t always know what to say<br>
Because if a thousand words could buy me a smile<br>
<br>
**This is** me going the extra mile

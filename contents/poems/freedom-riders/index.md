<p>I haven’t written in a slam in a while<br>
And when I ask myself why, it’s because I don’t think it matters<br>
For all my flashy adjectives, $2.00 words, and over extended metaphors,<br>
I don’t think I’ve made a damn bit of difference in the world<br>
<br>
Television continues to preach the gospel of narcissism and materialism<br>
Homeless people are still dents in the blindspot of society<br>
Closets remain stuffed with fewer rainboots than gays<br>
And school hasn’t gotten any less stressful<br>
But hey, Rome didn’t fall in a day<br>
And maybe we just haven’t waited long enough<br>
<br>
Or maybe I forgot why I started writing in the first place<br>
Writing has never been about fixing problems --<br>
Checkbooks and fists do that<br>
Writing is a coping machine<br>
A vehicle by which vast worlds of emotion can be explored<br>
Nevermind that the engine is stuck in neutral<br>
<br>
The fallacy is that people think that writing about something changes it<br>
It doesn’t. The only thing it does is make it easier to reprint.<br>
Because when fist come to glove,<br>
A dumptruck full of poems won’t cloth the homeless<br>
Any more that dreaming of syringes helps cure HIV<br>
<br>
The problem is that lately, I’ve been trapped under the weight of the impression<br>
That the only problem we have is that we’ve been using the wrong tools for the job<br>
It’s not. Maybe what we need right now is a gentle reminder<br>
That it’s *okay* to dream<br>
It’s *okay* to write<br>
Just as long as you understand that pencils and emotions can’t change the world<br>
Actions can<br>
<br>
And I’m not so naive to think that this poem is the answer<br>
But sometimes I worry that I’m letting things get too far<br>
Because I’m too busy daydreaming that<br>
I can’t even hear the sirens of my own somnambulence<br>
<br>
We’re the freedom riders with flat tires<br>
Sliding backwards off treadmills<br>
Just me, a cop who pulled this car over<br>
And you, a drunk driver with a nothing more than a poetic license<br>
<br>
Why are you so mad?<br>
They’re called first-world problems because they’re solved in that order<br>
So maybe if you dialed down the volume on your social megaphone<br>
We could figure out how to turn stories of malnourished kids in Africa into more than a good excuse for not throwing out your sandwich<br>
Since last time I checked you can’t cure starvation with food for thought<br>
<br>
But you couldn’t care less if you tried<br>
See in your world, screaming is always the right answer<br>
And now that your steaming rage is fogging up the mirror<br>
You can’t see the monster you’ve become<br>
So when your infant nephew starts crying<br>
Try reassuring him the ends justify the mean<br>
<br>
The only censorship you know is the beep on the answering machine<br>
And all you’ve got to show for it is a neverending stream<br>
Of sevenscore soliloquies dissing the American flag with trendy hashtags<br>
That pisses me off<br>
Because real progress is a verb<br>
And you can’t describe it in 140 characters or less</p>

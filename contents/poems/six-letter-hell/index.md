<p><span>They say you can never really have too much of a good thing</span><br><span>And trust me, stress sucks and I’ve got too much of it</span><br><span>It’s the emotional breakdown that wouldn’t back off with</span><br><span>Broken dreams and blushing screams of fears</span><br><span>Streaming through my tears</span><br><span>Shamelessly swallows my pride before I’ve got a chance to catch my breath</span><br><span>Sometimes I wonder where I can go to get a cup of coffee in a big room</span><br><span>And stand up an awkward introduction saying,</span><br><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Hi, I’m Me and I’m a workaholic”</span><br><span>But I’d never make it that far</span><br><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Too busy with school I forgot what I was learning</span><br><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Spent too much time catching up with the yesterday I never got around to</span><br><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Too hard?</span><br><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Too bad.</span><br><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Take this blood number and squint at it</span><br><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Try to find the value hidden between the digits</span><br><span>Trick question: there ain’t none</span><br><span>Oh, back up, my bad</span><br><span>I meant to say “there is none”&nbsp;</span><br><span>I forgot that in the real world what you say doesn’t matter, only how you say it does</span><br><span>Wait, screw that!</span><br><span>Last time I checked dignity didn’t have a writing requirement, and you could be called courageous whether you spell it with an “i” or an “e”</span><br><br><span>Ah, forget it</span><br><span>There’s no time or place to dream when you’re trapped in a six letter hell</span><br><span>Maybe there should be<br>Maybe we should stop calling it time management and start calling it</span><br><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Damage control</span><br><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Sorry, kid. It’s only your innocence, it’ll grow back”</span><br><span>Maybe we should spend some time learning about each other</span><br><span>Not studying the sacred scriptures of middle men who left the picture long before it was framed</span><br><span>I could stop my restless ranting and start living all 22 hours of the day</span><br><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or was it 24?</span><br><span>I guess I lost count of how many hours of sleep I’ve lost since the start of six letter hell</span><br><span>Or maybe I just stopped caring</span><br><br><span>Because we’re the generation of diligent dilettantes     <span><br>Left to obsess over this excess stress that we struggle without success to address and suppress</span><br><span>Stranded at sea with the stalkers struggling to</span><br><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Impress our friends</span><br><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but never</span><br><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Express our feelings</span><br><span>Who stole our sense of self?</span><br><span>Crowding around our collective consciousness</span><br><span>Scrolling the pages of the MagicBook where it’s all words and no action</span><br><span>Action’s not for us</span><br><span>We’re too politically incorrect to get bogged down with that stuff</span><br><span>Leave it to those radicals</span><br><span>Yeah, those crazies lurking the streets</span><br><span>I saw them on the magic box last week</span><br><span>Wearing war-torn rags,</span><br><span>Waving worn-down white flags down town and wailing about “peace”</span><br><span>I told them it’s my piece, they can get their own</span><br><span>There’s plenty more in this box of careers,</span><br><span>and this game’s only been going for the last sixteen years.</span> </span></p>

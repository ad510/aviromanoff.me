To address these problems without requiring teacher re-training or other involvement from the school’s administration, as a sophomore in high school, I reverse-engineered the existing homework website and provided an alternative interface to access. It grew quickly from a simple set of parsing algorithms and an HTTP proxy API for my personal use to a state-of-the-art personal productivity web app with wide adoption by my school community. Since launching in June 2012, 90% of the student body are use Keeba to track 55,000+ assignments across 2,000+ courses.</p><p><strong>How: </strong>Keeba is a client-heavy single-page style web app which makes heavy use of JavaScript and CoffeeScript. The client embraces the modern JavaScript MVC pattern (through Backbone) and the server is a highly modularized set of internal and external APIs. Keeba uses makes heavy use of UNIX IPC and process forking to maintain a high degree of concurrency and avoid clogging the eventloop.</p><p><strong>Stack: </strong>JavaScript (both client and server), CoffeeScript, Node.js, Backbone.js, MongoDB, Map/Reduce, Regular Expressions, Jade, HTML, CSS, WebSockets, various low-level *NIX APIs for IPC and deployment system</p></div><div class="project"><span class="epoch">(Winter 2013 - Present)</span><h2><a href="http://hworks.org" target="_blank"><span class="title">HWorks Initiative</span><img src="link.svg" class="link"></a></h2><p><strong>Why: </strong>Based on my experiences in conceiving and developing Keeba, I began investigating the need for modern, intuitive, homework management software on a global scale. I extracted the core values with which I built Keeba, and articulated them as a broader vision for what next-generation digital homework management systems should strive for. I created an online organization, HWorks, as a collaborative hub for exploring these ideas and collecting the individual efforts made by students around the country and the world to address similar issues in their own schools. HWorks was launched 2013.</p><p><strong>How: </strong>The HWorks website is uses modern responsive CSS techniques to adapt its presentation to the various display sizes it might be viewed on. The website is completely static and is hosted via GitHub Pages.</p><p><strong>Stack: </strong>Responsive CSS, Skeleton web grid system, Jade templating language, icons from The Noun Project</p></div><div class="project"><span class="epoch">(Summer 2012)</span><h2><a href="http://veritas-me.com" target="_blank"><span class="title">Veritas Social Network</span><img src="link.svg" class="link"></a></h2><p><strong>Why: </strong>While studying computer science at the Harvard Summer School as a rising junior, I greatly enjoyed meeting and getting to know new students each day. However, after the first week, I realized that this strategy would not scale. Before too long, the summer would be over, and there would be many students with whom I had not connect. Therefore, I created an informal on-line social network exclusively for other Harvard Summer School students. I wrote a program to scrape the Harvard Summer School website and compile and a database of all of the courses offered that summer. Students signed up with their Harvard IDs, and selected the courses in which they were enrolled, and the dorm in which they lived. The website, which I named Veritas after the motto of Harvard, was composed of various chat rooms for these different groups, as well as a general chat for all students. I posted the link to the Facebook group for the 2012 Harvard Summer School session, and just 24 hours later over 100 had signed up.</p><p><strong>How: </strong>Veritas's IRC-like chatrooms are powered by Socket.IO, which intelligently selects the fastest and most reliable realtime transport scheme available for a given client. Veritas's storage system strongly leverages the power of MongoDB's schemaless documents, which allows for one unified user model to adapt on the fly to the dorm and courses of each individual student &mdash; without needing knowledge of other students in those groups.</p><p><strong>Stack: </strong>CSS3 and HTML5, JavaScript, Backbone.js, jQuery, CoffeeScript, Node.js, Bootstrap CSS framework, MongoDB, Heroku, Python, BeautifulSoup HTML parsing library, WebSockets</p></div><div class="project"><span class="epoch">(Winter 2011 - Summer 2012)</span><h2> <a href="https://launchpad.net/switchboard" target="_blank"><span class="title">Switchboard Settings Center</span><img src="link.svg" class="link"></a></h2><p><strong>Why: </strong>I have been using Linux as my desktop operating system for two years, after having migrated from Mac OS X. When I made the transition, I was frustrated by the lack of coherence and cohesion, both technically and graphically, of the system settings in Linux desktop environments. Each settings panel is typically developed individually, by different projects with different goals and user interfaces, making it cumbersome and confusing for users to change and view settings on their computers. I created a desktop-agnostic, modular, organized and friendly system to solve this ubiquitous modern Linux problem. The system is called Switchboard, and consists of a user-facing graphical interface that organizes the configuration panels installed into categories, and an API with a Vala/C/GTK+ library that enables developers to create settings panels for Switchboard. Switchboard will be included in the next version of elementaryOS (Luna), and is licensed under the GNU LGPL version 2.</p><p>As a result of my involvement with elementary and my work on Switchboard, I was invited to and attended the 2011 Ubuntu Developer Summer in Orlando, Florida. I presented the software to a panel of Canonical engineers and it is being considered for adoption by Ubuntu and other free desktop projects.</p><p><strong>How: </strong>Foobar was built using the latest herpderps, lol</p><p><strong>Stack: </strong>Vala, C, WAF and CMake packaging frameworks, GTK+, D-Bus, Bazaar, Launchpad</p></div><div class="project"><span class="epoch">(Spring 2011)</span><h2><span class="title">Centropa Interactive Sign-In Map </span></h2><p><strong>Why: </strong>In my freshman year of high school my grade organized and ran an exhibit on pre- World War II Jewish life in Europe, as a part of the international organization Centropa. My part in the exhibit was the creation of a digital sign-in book and projected map that allows the visitors to type in their name and ancestor's country of origin, and have their location marked on a digitally projected map of the world. I collaborated on this project with a classmate. </p><p><strong>How: </strong>Foobar was built using the latest herpderps, lol</p><p><strong>Stack: </strong>Python, WebPy framework, JavaScript/AJAX, Apache and Cherokee Web Servers, JSON, XML, Google Maps API, PyGTK</p></div><div class="project"><span class="epoch">(Spring 2011 - Summer 2013)</span><h2> <a href="https://launchpad.net/lingo" target="_blank"><span class="title">Lingo Dictionary</span><img src="link.svg" class="link"></a></h2><p><strong>Why: </strong>Lingo is not a completely separate project from Purple (see below), but rather a completely re- architected rewrite, that will replace and succeed Purple. The purpose of the rewrite was to greatly improve performance (Lingo is written in a language that compiles into binary, unlike Purple which relies of the resource-taxing Python environment), improve modularity, internationalization capabilities, and portability. Additionally, as Wordnik provides no official wrapper or support for the Vala programming language, I needed to design and implement my own wrapper to interface with their API. Like Lingo, the program is licensed under the GNU GPL version 3. It will be included in the upcoming release of elementaryOS, code-named Luna. </p><p><strong>How: </strong>Foobar was built using the latest herpderps, lol</p><p><strong>Stack: </strong>Vala, GTK+, LibSoup, SQLite, Waf packaging framework, Launchpad, Bazaar, Git, D-Bus, JSON-GLib, Wordnik API, JSON </p></div><div class="project"><span class="epoch">(Fall 2010 - Spring 2011)</span><h2> <a href="https://launchpad.net/purple" target="_blank"><span class="title">Purple Dictionary</span><img src="link.svg" class="link"></a></h2><p><strong>Why: </strong>I recognized that Linux lacked an easy to use and functional desktop dictionary. I therefore created this program to provide a graphical front end to Dictionary.com's (and later Wordnik's) web services, enhanced with tools such as bookmarking and automatic flashcard generation. This program is fully open source and is hosted on Ubuntu's code development platform, Launchpad. It is licensed under the GNU GPL version 3, and shipped in the initial release of the elementaryOS operating system, code-named Jupiter.</p><p><strong>How: </strong>Foobar was built using the latest herpderps, lol</p><p><strong>Stack: </strong>Python, PyGTK, BeautifulSoup, DOM, XML, SQLite, Quickly framework, Launchpad, Bazaar, Storm ORM, D-Bus, Dictionary.com API, Wordnik API, JSON </p></div><div class="project"><span class="epoch">(Fall 2010 - Fall 2011)</span><h2><span class="title">Lingua Vocabulary Index </span></h2><p><strong>Why: </strong>As I student of Latin at my high school, my classmates and I (and Latin students around the world) struggle with a lack of modern (technologically speaking), easy-to-use, and fast digital Latin dictionaries. As a requirement of my Latin course, I maintain a list of all of the Latin vocabulary that I learn in class on a Word document. To help my own studies and my classmates', I created a website and API that allows anyone to search my Latin dictionary Word document, which I parsed and stored in a relational database. The website searches using a clean and elegant minimalistic interface with real-time, as-you-type, results. It can search in either Latin or English.<p><strong>How:
